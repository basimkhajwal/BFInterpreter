# BF Interpreter

A very simple front-end BrainFuck interpreter written in Scala using ScalaJS.

The goal of this project is to learn ScalaJS and to highlight the differences between two reactive libraries available: [ScalaJS-React](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react) and [Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala). Both libraries have been used independently to create the same product, a basic BrainFuck interpreter.
